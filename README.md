# Pokemon Astral Jade

A hack made with [**RHH's pokeemerald-expansion**](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) where you can traverse altered region of Johto and Hoenn.

### Features

- Begin your journey in Hoenn as usual, but get sent to explore Johto after getting 3rd badge.
- A curated pokedex of about 450 Pok√©mons excluding legendaries.
- Sky Gateway, a multi-layered dungeon that unlocks more layers as you progress through the regular game. Face tough enemies and gain powerful rewards!
- Additional areas in both region, giving player access to more varied biomes and opportunies to find new Pok√©mon and rewards.
- Large focus on giving each legendary a proper event rather than making them gifts or roamers.
- Battle facilities have been scattered around the region, and they scale your party to 50 regardless of level.
- Mega evolutions converted to regular, lategame evolutions/forms to spice up the high level progression.
- New abilities and moves to experiment with.
- Common QoL, you know the drill
